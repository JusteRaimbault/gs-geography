/**
 * The descriptor is the main tool to select geographic objects, filter them and
 * convert them from a library-dependent format to a more standard
 * representation.
 * 
 * The heart of a descriptor is its matching method. If an object matches the
 * inner definition of a descriptor then it is kept for the next step of the
 * import. The user can specify the geometric type of the objects he wants to
 * consider (points, lines or polygons) and the attributes they should possess.
 * 
 * Descriptors are also in charge of converting input geographical objects into
 * GraphStream geometric elements (simple Points, Lines and Polygons with
 * attributes). As such, the implementation of a descriptor needs to be capable
 * of determining the type of a feature and of instantiating a new Point, Line
 * and Polygon from the input format of the considered object by means of the
 * isXXX(), newXXX() and newXXXDiff() methods.
 * 
 * Moreover, the library-specific object is only converted after it has been
 * matched (for efficiency reasons). Thus, a descriptor must be capable of
 * reading its attribute from its original format using the hasKey() and
 * hasKeyValue() methods.
 * 
 * For all these reasons, each implementation of the Descriptor base class must
 * focus on a single input format.
 * 
 * Note that the attributes of matched elements are reduced to the set of
 * attributes specified by the user through a filtering process. This way, a lot
 * of memory is saved (some geographic files are huge) and the output graph is
 * not cluttered by meaningless data.
