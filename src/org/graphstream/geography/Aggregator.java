 * An aggregator is a format-specific reader that goes through all input files

 * that match the descriptors of the source.

 * The aggregated data is structured so that different versions of an element
 * are indexed by the time of their appearance.
 * 
 * It is possible to only aggregate features ID instead of keeping a record of
 * all their data (attributes and shape). This is especially useful to check at
 * which moments a feature appears without wasting memory.
