 * It contains a list of descriptors which goal is to filter and classify the
 * features coming from data sources. This process has dual advantages. First,
 * it obviously gives better control to the user over the data as he can bind
 * matching features to custom categories (e.g. "ROAD", "LAKE", "LAND LOT") for
 * a later use. Secondly, geographical data files are often huge in size and
 * reducing the memory usage at the first step of the import surely is a good
 * idea.
 * 
 * All the geographical elements that pass the descriptors matching tests are
 * kept in memory in a spatial index whereas the others are simply ignored.
