/**
 * An abstract geometric element.
 * 
 * This class serves as a base for Point, Line and Polygon. These are used as
 * intermediary representations for any kind of geographical features coming
 * from an external source. The original input formats can be quite
 * heterogeneous as the data they contain is library-dependent and we don't want
 * to force the user to learn GeoTools, XOM or whatever other library.
 * 
 * An Element basically consists of a unique identifier and a list of attributes
 * copied from the original format of the feature (potentially filtered).
 * 
 * An element can exist in two flavors. The "base" version is a complete element
 * with some attributes. The "diff" version is a partial element that is based
 * on a "base" element and only contains the differences between these two
 * versions. This duality becomes useful when dealing with several time steps.
 * The change of an element with respect to time is represented by a chain
 * starting with a "base" element and followed by zero or more "diff" elements.
